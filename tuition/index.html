            <p>
              All rates listed below include most enrichment programs, as well as lunch and snacks (does not include special dietary requirements). Some activity fees are charged separately. Tuition is due in full by 10:00 every Tuesday. A late fee of $30 (per week) is applied to any past due charges and returned checks. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to COVID-19 and our effort to reduce the handling of cash and checks in tnhe office, electronic forms of payment are strongly preferred. Paying via an active electronic payment account will keep the account current and avoid assessment of late payment fees. Please contact our Accounts Manager to set up electronic payments.

              Registration Fee + Deposit: $130 (federal)/$160 (non-federal) + a non-refundable two-week deposit is required – due upon confirmation of child’s start date. <i>NO FEES WILL BE CHARGED OR ACCEPTED UNTIL A CHILD’S START DATE IS CONFIRMED.<sup>Ɨ</sup></i>

            <p>
            <i>Holding Fee:</i>  For families who wish to take an extended leave of absence (4-12 weeks), a flat rate holding fee equal to two weeks of tuition is required in order to hold an enrollment opening. Holding fees are non-refundable and cannot be applied to any other charges. Tuition charges will resume immediately upon return. Families may use all accrued vaction benefits prior to the leave of absence but will become ineligible for vaction benefits once enrollment is place on hold. Children become eligible for applicable vacation benefits six months after their return to regular enrollment. <i>Enrollment openings may only be placed on hold with prior approval-see Admissions Director for approval at least two weeks prior to leave.</i>

            <p><strong>*</strong> Sibling Discount of 10% off tuition is available for additional (older) child(ren) for full-time families with (all) siblings on a full-time schedule.</p>
            <p><strong>**</strong> Payment options provided separately.  Please see Association Bylaws in our Parent Policy Handbook for more information.</p>
            <p><strong>Ɨ</strong> Infant enrollment is highly competitive and start dates are often confirmed up to six months prior to the child’s first day. Please plan ahead and turn in enrollment forms early to avoid missing the enrollment window. Openings are not guaranteed with late enrollment, regardless of federal employment status and sibling preference. Every effort will be made to honor start date requests, but flexibility from families may be required.</p>

            <h3>Enrollment Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Part-Time:</strong>  2-3 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Full-Time:</strong>  4-5 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p >Note: Children may attend up to 10 hours per day.  Overtime charges apply to any child that is at the Center more than their contracted hours per week (i.e. enrolled 3 days per week x 10 hrs. = 30 hrs. per week).  No half-day rates are available, although Drop-In/Daily care &amp;/or Hourly care is available per prior approval from one of the Directors, when space allows.  Waiting List/Start Date priority is given to federal federal families, families with children already enrolled (sibling preference), and those seeking full-time enrollment. <em>Sibling Discount is available for full-time families only</em>.</p>
            <p ><strong>Weekly Contract:</strong>  Families that enroll their child(ren) part-time must contract for specific days of the week, to be changed only upon approval from the Directors.  Families that wish to attend on different days each week must pay for a full-time slot in their child(ren)’s classroom(s), in order to allow for this type of scheduling flexibility.</p>

            <h3>Vacation/Sick Leave<sup>***</sup></h3>
            <p ><strong>Full-Time:</strong> Six months after each child’s confirmed start date, children who are enrolled full-time are eligible for two weeks of vacation/sick leave per enrollment year. Vacation/sick leave must be used as a full week (Monday–Friday). Kinderplatz requires a two-week notice for one of these weeks and will accept short notice for the other week.</p>
            <p ><strong>Part-Time:</strong> Six months after each child’s confirmed start date, children who are enrolled part-time are eligible for one week of vacation/sick leave per enrollment year (i.e. a child who is enrolled for 3 days/week will receive a “week” of vacation/sick leave based on a 3-day week). Vacation/sick leave must be used within the same week (Monday–Friday). A two-week notice is preferred.</p>
            <p>
              *** Please Note:
              <ul class="subnote no-margin">
                <li>If a family switches from part-time to full-time enrollment, the child will be eligible for full-time vacation/sick leave <i>six months after</i> the contract change.  If switching from full-time to part-time enrollment, the part-time vacation/sick leave policy applies <i>six months after</i> the contract change.</li>
                <li>Vacation/sick leave will be prorated accordingly when children’s enrollment changes from part-time to full-time, and vice-versa.  <i>For example, a child who attends part-time (3 days/week) for 4 months before switching to full-time will receive a 3-day week of vacation/sick leave 6 months after part-time enrollment began.  The second week of vacation/sick leave (a full 5 days) will become available 6 months after switching to full-time enrollment.  The full two weeks of vacation/sick leave will become available once the child has been enrolled full-time for 12 months.</i></li>

            <h3>Holiday Closings/Child Absence</h3>
            <p><strong>Full-Time:</strong>  The tuition for the weeks in which holidays occur remains the same as any other week.  Families will pay weekly tuition rates even when their child is absent due to illness, appointments, or any other reason (with the exception of approved Vacation/Sick Leave).</p>
            <p><strong>Part-Time:</strong>  If the Center is closed due to a holiday on a child’s contracted day, the family will not be required to pay for the day of closure.  Families will pay for contracted days even when their child is absent due to illness, appointments, or any other reason (with the exception of approved Vacation/Sick Leave).</p>
