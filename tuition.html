                      <p class="bodytxt"><strong>Part-Time:</strong> Six months after each child’s confirmed start date, children who are enrolled part-time are eligible for one week of vacation/sick leave per enrollment year (i.e. a child who is enrolled for 3 days/week will receive a “week” of vacation/sick leave based on a 3-day week). Vacation/sick leave must be used within the same week (Monday–Friday). A two-week notice is preferred.</p>

                          <li>If a family switches from part-time to full-time enrollment, the child will be eligible for full-time vacation/sick leave <i>six months after</i> the contract change.

                          <li>Vacation/sick leave will be prorated accordingly when children’s enrollment changes from part-time to full-time, and vice-versa.  <i>For example, a child who attends part-time (3 days/week) for 4 months before switching to full-time will receive a 3-day week of vacation/sick leave 6 months after part-time enrollment began.  The second week of vacation/sick leave (a full 5 days) will become available 6 months after switching to full-time enrollment.
