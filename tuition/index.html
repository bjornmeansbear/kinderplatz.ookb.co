              All rates listed below include most enrichment programs, as well as lunch and snacks (does not include special dietary requirements). Some activity fees are charged separately. Tuition is due in full by 10:00 every Tuesday. A late fee of $30 (per week) is applied to any past due charges and returned checks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Electronic forms of payment are strongly preferred. Paying via an active electronic payment account will keep the account current and avoid assessment of late payment fees. Please contact our Accounts Manager to set up electronic payments.

Holding fees are non-refundable and cannot be applied to any other charges. Tuition charges will resume immediately upon return. Families may use all accrued vacation benefits prior to the leave of absence but will become ineligible for vacation benefits once enrollment is place on hold.

            <p><strong>Ɨ</strong> Infant enrollment is highly competitive and start dates are often confirmed up to six months prior to the child’s first day. Please plan ahead and turn in enrollment forms early to avoid missing the enrollment window. Openings are not guaranteed with late enrollment, regardless of federal employment status and sibling preference. Every effort will be made to honor start date requests, but flexibility from families may be required.</p>

            <h3>Enrollment Definitions</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Part-Time:</strong>  2 days or 3 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Full-Time:</strong>  4-5 days enrollment per week.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p >Note: Children may attend up to 10 hours per day.  Overtime charges apply to any child that is at the Center more than their contracted hours per week (i.e. enrolled 3 days per week x 10 hrs. = 30 hrs. per week).  No half-day rates are available, although Drop-In/Daily care &amp;/or Hourly care is available per prior approval from one of the Directors, when space allows.  Waiting List/Start Date priority is given to federal federal families, families with children already enrolled (sibling preference), and those seeking full-time enrollment. <em>Sibling Discount is available for full-time families only</em>.</p>
            <p ><strong>Weekly Contract:</strong>  Families that enroll their child(ren) part-time must contract for specific days of the week, to be changed only upon approval from the Directors.  Families that wish to attend on different days each week must pay for a full-time slot in their child(ren)’s classroom(s), in order to allow for this type of scheduling flexibility.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Vacation/Sick Leave<sup>***</sup></h3>
            <p ><strong>Full-Time:</strong> Six months after each child’s confirmed start date, children who are enrolled full-time are eligible for two weeks of vacation/sick leave tuition credit per enrollment year. Vacation/sick leave must be used as a full week (Monday–Friday). Kinderplatz requires a two-week notice for one of these weeks and will accept short notice for the other week.</p>
            <p ><strong>Part-Time:</strong> Six months after each child’s confirmed start date, children who are enrolled part-time are eligible for one week of vacation/sick leave tuition credit per enrollment year (i.e. a child who is enrolled for 3 days/week will receive a “week” of vacation/sick leave based on a 3-day week). Vacation/sick leave must be used within the same week (Monday–Friday). A two-week notice is preferred.</p>
            <p>
              *** Please Note: Current tuition terms and policies will be provided upon enrollment.
