      <p class="bodytxt">Kinderplatz is licensed by the Minnesota Department of Human Services and has been accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) since 1994. NAEYC is the benchmark for high quality childcare across the nation, and we are proud of the work we do to maintain the high standards NAEYC requires of its members.</p>

      <!-- Staff ¶ -->
      <h4 class="bordertop">Staff</h4>
      <p class="bodytxt">Our administrative team and all staff members at Kinderplatz are well qualified through Early Childhood Development education (many with Associates and Bachelor&#x27;s degrees), annual training, and years of hands-on experience. There are staff members fluent in Spanish, Vietnamese, and Finnish&hellip;just to name a few. We also have resources to offer verbal assistance in some other foreign languages upon request.</p>
      <p class="bodytxt">All classroom staff is certified in Pediatric First Aid and CPR, and trained in the prevention of Abusive Head Trauma (formerly Shaken Baby Syndrome). The infant staff also has SUID training (formerly SIDS).</p>
      <p class="bodytxt">Most of the primary teaching staff has been with the program for more than 10 years (some for more than 20 years). The staff&rsquo;s low turnover level is extremely unique in the field of early childhood education, and keeps our in-service training focused on continual program improvement and advancement. The longevity of Kinderplatz staff provides ample opportunity for caregivers to develop secure, lasting attachments with children and their families, which is vitally important during these critical first years of life.</p>
